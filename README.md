# Project Overview
We developed a dashboard for users to view health metrics collected from a smartphone and wearable device. The main feature we were able to implement is an interactive sleep summary in a calendar view. Users can easily click on any day in the calendar to see more details from that day. The dashboard is built using the T3 stack, which includes Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
